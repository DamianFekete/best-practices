# Work methods

## Agile / Scrum

- Start sprints on Wednesday to reduce the absence in sprint meetings due to days off and remote working.

## Remote work

- Go [remote-first](https://zachholman.com/posts/remote-first/), meaning you build your development team around a workflow that embraces the concepts of remote work, whether or not your employees are remote.
- Always use a camera in addition to audio during remote meetings.

## Time management

- Consider using the [Pomodoro technique](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique) to improve the focus and reduce distractions.
